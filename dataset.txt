The Dataset: Cleveland Clinic Heart Disease
For this task, we'll use the well-known Heart Disease UCI dataset, specifically the processed Cleveland Clinic dataset. It's a staple in the machine learning community for classification tasks. This dataset contains 14 attributes (like age, sex, chest pain type, etc.) and a target variable indicating the presence or absence of heart disease.

Why this dataset?

Clean and Ready: It's already been cleaned and pre-processed, making it easy to plug directly into a model.

Well-Understood: It has been extensively studied, so the expected model performance is well-documented.

Accessible: It's readily available online.
