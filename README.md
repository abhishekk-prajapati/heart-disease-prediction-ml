# heart-disease-prediction-ml
This project implements an AI-based heart disease prediction system using machine learning models, including Random Forest, Linear Regression, and Sigmoid Function (Logistic Regression). The model is trained and evaluated using the University of Cleveland (UCI) Heart Disease dataset to accurately predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients.
